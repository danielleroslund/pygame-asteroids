# 🚀 Asteroids – A Python Arcade Game

This is a simple clone of the classic *Asteroids* arcade game, built with Python and Pygame. You control a spaceship that can rotate, move, and shoot bullets to destroy incoming asteroids. When hit, large asteroids split into smaller ones, creating fast-paced, dynamic gameplay.

## 🎯 Features
- Player movement and shooting
- Asteroid spawning and splitting
- Collision detection between shots, asteroids, and the player
- Clean object-oriented code structure

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python 3.10+**
- **Pygame**
- Unix-like shell (e.g. macOS Terminal, Bash, Zsh)

## ▶️ Run the Game
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
